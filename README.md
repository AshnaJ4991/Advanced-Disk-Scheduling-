ðŸš€ Advanced Disk Scheduler

This project presents a comprehensive simulation of advanced disk scheduling techniques, aimed at optimizing disk I/O operations. 
It builds upon traditional algorithms like FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, and LOOK, and introduces priority-based request handling, deadline-aware scheduling, and a simulated machine learning prediction engine for intelligent decision-making.

ðŸ“š Project Overview

Modern systems demand faster data retrieval and efficient resource management. 
Traditional disk scheduling approaches, although functional, fall short when dealing with dynamic workloads, priority requests, and real-time deadlines.

This project enhances classic scheduling methods by:
Reducing total seek time.
Improving throughput and system responsiveness.
Handling dynamic, priority-driven, and deadline-sensitive workloads.
Predicting future requests through a basic ML simulation for smarter head movement decisions.

ðŸ”¥ Features
Implementation of Multiple Scheduling Algorithms:
First Come First Serve (FCFS)
Shortest Seek Time First (SSF)
SCAN (Elevator Algorithm
C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
LOOK Algorithm

Advanced Enhancements:
Priority-based request servicing.
Deadline-aware task scheduling.
Predictive disk access simulation using request history.
Performance tracking and logging (head movement, seek time).
Flexible sorting options (track number, priority, arrival time).

Technology Stack:
Programming Language: C
Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
Tools: Visual Studio Code, OnlineGDB
Libraries: stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, stdbool.h, limits.h

ðŸ“ˆ Project Flow
